## [Unreleased]
- Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure) completed: basic server setup with FastMCP, configuration management, Obsidian API client, and basic file operations.
- Major refactor: switched to explicit @mcp.prompt decorators for prompt registration, matching FastMCP SDK and best practices. Removed dynamic prompt execution logic.
